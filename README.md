# Message Viewer

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.
Message Viewer is a program that takes in ".msg" inputs and displays the
contents of the message as it would be displayed in an email viewer (such as Microsoft Outlook).

## Requirements
- Docker version 19.03.13

    OR

- NPM Package Manager version 7

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/manasa-kulkarni/ParseMessages.git

```

## Run the Application (Using Docker - Recommended)
```bash
cd ParseMessages
docker-compose --build
```

## Run the Application (Using NPM - Not recommended as npm version conflicts can lead to issues)
```bash
cd ParseMessages/api
node server.js
```
In another Terminal:
```bash
cd ParseMessages/ui
npm start
```

## Other Notes
This program was created to parse .msg files. However, not all .msg files are created
according to the same standards. This program is intended to be used with most of the
.msg file subset I was given. This may lead to some non-accurately rendered emails when opening certain .msg files.
